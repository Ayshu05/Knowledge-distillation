# Knowledge-distillation

Developed an autoencoder based anomaly detection system and applied to the UCSD PED dataset. By
utilizing knowledge distillation techniques, the model effectively identifies anomalies within the dataset,
enhancing data quality and reliability for improved decision-making and insights.
